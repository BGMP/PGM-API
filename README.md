Note
===

This project is heavily outdated. I have decided to open-source it as a favour for anybody looking for persistent
PGM stats-tracking. It is also to note that the project is also experimental and may not suit your needs, as it was
meant to work within a specific environment. Needless to say, I will not maintain this in time.

PGM-API

API used for PGM persistent data-tracking.
